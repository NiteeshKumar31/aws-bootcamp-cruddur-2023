## Getting Started with AWS CLI

- We will be making use of Gitpod as part of AWS CLI installation.
- Open Gitpod through your Github repositoty and start executing the below commands.
-  [AWS CLI Reference Documentation](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/index.html)

```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install
```
## Configure your aws account in Gitpod

- Make use of below commands, add your account details and run them in CLI.

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=""
```
#### As we don't want to configure our account every time we run a workspace, we better save the variable details in gitpod.

- Save above aws account details in gitpod environmental variables, run them in CLI.

```
gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
gp env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
gp env AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=""
```

- Check whether user existed in Gitpod AWS CLI

```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

You should get something like this with details :).

```
{
    "UserId": "",
    "Account": "",
    "Arn": ""
}
```

## Creating a Budget through AWS CLI

[Budget CLI Reference documention](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/budgets/create-budget.html#examples)

- Get your Account ID by running below command through CLI

```
aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text
```
- Fill all the required details below and run the same in AWS CLI

```
aws budgets create-budget \
    --account-id $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID \

### Create SNS Topic for Billing

- We need a new SNS topic before we create an alarm.
- The SNS topic send out a delivery to us an alert when we get overbilled
- [aws sns create-topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sns/create-topic.html)

Create a SNS Topic by running below command through CLI

```
aws sns create-topic --name billing-alarm-cli
```
which will return a TopicARN

We'll create a subscription with the help of TopicARN and our Email

```
aws sns subscribe \
    --topic-arn=TopicARN \
    --protocol=email \
    --notification-endpoint=pinjalaniteesh@email.com
```

Check your email and confirm the subscription


### Create an Billing Alarm

- [aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/put-metric-alarm.html)
- [Create an Alarm via AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudwatch-estimatedcharges-alarm/)
- We need to update the configuration json script with the TopicARN we generated earlier
- We will be making use of Create an Alarm via AWS CLI link to create json file. 
- Change Alarm actions in alarm-config-json file to your own alarm by filling below details
```
rn:aws:sns:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT_ID>:<SNS_TOPIC_NAME>
```
- One's this is down now run below command to create alarm
```sh
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --cli-input-json file://aws/json/alarm-config.json
```

#### Issues that i had while working on Week0

- AWS CLI didn't istalled on my first try and i found out it's due to not yml file(It's not updted properly)
- Had issues while perfoming budgets and billing alarms on my first try and went with manual creation istead through CLI. Cameback other day and successfully completed creating budgets and billing alarms through CLI.
- Had issues while pushing the chages to Github account(Couldn't capture the error though) but cameback after sometime and completed pushing successfully.
- Having some issues while uploading the images into markdown files. Checking on it.
- Mostly i worked on all the things twice in Week-0 inorder to complete them succesfully. Hoping i could do the things in my first Attempt in Week-1 :)
